List-Organizer--Directory-Listing-
==================================

Easy simple way to organize your lists of videos/projects/whatever you want.  No database needed, uses xml.

Here's a demo video to see how it works:

To make the form show up add ?admin=1 to your URL.

Add whatever you like.  All the columns are editable.

THIS IS BY NO MEANS MEANT TO BE PUBLICLY ACCESSABLE.  There is no security or anything on this and it's truly the most basic it can be.  I had to do it as a quick project for INTERNAL USE ONLY!

If you use this and want to make it public YOU WILL have to make changes to it.

It absolutely served it's purpose though for what I needed it for.

Enjoy!
